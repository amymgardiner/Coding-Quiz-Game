# Coding Quiz Game

This application was developed to create a typical coding assessment, as a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

This app can be used by any coding boot camp student who wants to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that they can gauge their progress compared to their peers.

The code is also set up so that only a few changes need to be made if I'd like to add more questions, with a longer time limit, later on.

## How the Application Works

When you click the start button on the home page, then you are directed to the game page where a timer starts and you are presented with a question.

When you answer the question, then you are presented with another question. If you answer incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, then the game is over.

Once the game is over, then you can save your name and score, if it is above zero.
